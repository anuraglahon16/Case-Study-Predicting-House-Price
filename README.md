# Case Study Predicting House Price
Case study by using best model using linear regression

# Objective
AGENDA is to build a model to predict the selling price of the new houses coming onto the market

# Analytical Overview
1. Analysis of Data : 

  Types of Data- All the variables are numeric. No categorical data

  Missing Data- No missing data in the data set.

  Analysis- EDA and Multiple Linear Regression followed by Model Validation

2. Package used :  

  ggplot,dplyr,olsrr,car,boot,DataExplorer

3. Visualization:

   Histogram, Bar graphs,Density plot, Scatterplot, pairplot, heatmap

# Conclusion :

1.List Price is the proxy to Selling Price , so including list price as a predictor variable decreases the significance of the other variables included.

2.The best model to predict the selling price of the homes in Colorado Ski Resort is SELLING PRICE= 266.26 + 20.65(BEDROOMS) + 0.042(SQ_FT) â€“ 4.55(MOUNTAIN) + 14.14(GARAGE) + 4.16(LOT SIZE)

3.The age or the time the house is on market do not effect the selling price.

4.With the increasing miles of mountain base , the selling price decreases. So lower the miles of mountain better the selling price.
